non-planetary round time for universal timekeeping

____

Non-planetary Round Time (NRT) is a system I created for galactically neutral time.
It has 360 days in a year, 12 months each with 30 days, and 60 weeks.
Every single year has the exact same calendar; there are no leap years nor leap seconds nor leap days.

It is not aligned with the seasons or days of Earth, nor Mars, nor Venus or any planet humans could ever pay attention to.
NRT Time is galactically neutral and its purpose is not for alignment of a planet, but to help people across the world and across all worlds share the exact same time for timekeeping and convenience.

It is round because all numbers in it divide nicely:
360 days; 12 months in each year; 5 weeks in each month; 6 days in each week; 24 hours in each day; 60 minutes in each hour; 60 seconds in each minute.
30 days in each month; 60 weeks in each year.

You do not need to buy a new calendar every 360 days, as each NRT year has the exact same layout as the last.

This is what all 12 months of all years look like:

(We no longer have Sunday; Monday, Tuesday, Wednestay, Thurstay, Friday, and Saturday are the days of the week.)
